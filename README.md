**That's the flutter side, and the firebase side will be provided soon.**

# INFO
It follows a feature-based architecture, which I think is the best for reusing code.  
It uses firebase as a backend, however, it doesn't depend on firebase and can be configured to another cloud source easily.

### Project structure
- core: for all non-feature things, shared stuff.  
each feature has three folders:
- state: for state management & error presenting.
- data: for all related to data things & error handling.
- view: for presentation.
